There may be necessary applications you may need (such as xviewer, gwenview, kwrite, Loupe...) ; in this case you may need to replace them with the Flathub version (which is installed after you execute this script); due to their Flathub versions being up-to-date, highly stable, and reduces the likelihood of system crashes.*
